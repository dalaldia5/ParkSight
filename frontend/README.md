# 🅿️ Smart Parking Detection System – AI-Powered Parking Occupancy Predictor

A deep learning–based **Smart Parking System** built using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and the PKLot dataset. This project predicts whether a parking space is **occupied** or **empty** using a CNN-based image classifier — now enhanced with a **real-time video-based detection module** using **OpenCV**, enabling live monitoring through video streams or CCTV feeds.
